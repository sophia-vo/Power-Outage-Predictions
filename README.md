# Power-Outage-Predictions
DSC 80 Final Project at UCSD

### Introduction
**Dataset:** Power Outages
<br/> &nbsp;  -  This dataset explores the major power outage data in the 48 contiguous states in the US from January 2000 to July 2016. 
<br/>
<br/>
**Question:** Is the average outage duration for power outages caused by severe weather equal to the average outage duration for power outages caused by experiment failure?
<br/> * This question is significant as analyzing the differences in effects of causes of power outages can help inform solutions 
<br/>
<br/>
**Rows:** 1534 
<br/>
<br/>
**Column Information:**
<br/>
**OBS:** 
<br/>
**YEAR:** Indicates the year when the outage event occurred
<br/>
**MONTH:** Indicates the month when the outage event occurred
<br/>
U.S._STATE: Represents all the states in the continental U.S.
<br/>
CLIMATE.REGION: U.S. Climate regions as specified by National Centers for Environmental Information (nine climatically consistent regions in continental U.S.A.)
<br/>
CAUSE.CATEGORY: Categories of all the events causing the major power outages
<br/>
CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL: Detailed description of the event categories causing the major power outages
<br/>
OUTAGE.DURATION: Duration of outage events (in minutes)
<br/>
CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED: Number of customers affected by the power outage event
<br/>
OUTAGE.START: This variable indicates the day of the year and the time of the day when the outage event started (as reported by the corresponding Utility in the region)
<br/>
OUTAGE.RESTORATION: This variable indicates the day of the year and the time of the day when power was restored to all the customers (as reported by the corresponding Utility in the region)
